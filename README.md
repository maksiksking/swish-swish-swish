# Fancy ai gesture based lock opener
Made with Vue, Tauri and Mediapipe. It pretty much just detects gestures like 👍, 👎, ✌️, ☝️, ✊, 👋, 🤟 with Mediapipe's AI.

Also [swish-swish-swish@45028b8](https://github.com/maksiksking/swish-swish-swish/commit/45028b87c286d38ef5e84b6c664af67bd9099ced) is pretty much a working Vue (kinda-reactive even) implementation of the Google Mediapipe's gesture recognition [example](https://mediapipe-studio.webapps.google.com/studio/demo/gesture_recognizer) Codepen.
